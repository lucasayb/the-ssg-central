description: This site is new. I'm relatively new too in the SSG world. But I'm pretty sure that I have enough knowledge to share with others.

I'm currently the Solution Maker and Account Manager in Keyrus Latam Digital team. Before that, I was the CTO of Codeby, responsible to lead a team with almost 60 developers. My focus was always e-commerce, but I always loved to discover things and learn new stuff. Havign a site is something that I do since forever and everytime that I find a bit of time, I decide to post something new in [my personal blog](https://www.lucasyamamoto.com).

However, I feel the necessity to share ideas and new knowledges. I worked with Jekyll, Gatsby, currently working with Hugo for this website, even built [my own SSG](https://www.lucasyamamoto.com/i-changed-my-entire-website-from-gatsby-to-go-lang).

I built this site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the [Hugo Theme Stack designed by Jimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It's a good theme, it's beautiful, quick and easy to implement.

The thing is: I think it's good to have a place dedicated to post tips and help anyone to built their own static website without having the entire development knowledge.

Let's see how this goes.
